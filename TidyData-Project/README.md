# 🏅 Tidy Data Project: 2008 Olympics Medalists

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **tidy data principles** to clean and analyze **2008 Olympics medalist data**. Using Python and **Streamlit**, the app transforms a raw dataset into a structured format, making it easier to analyze and visualize.

### 🔹 Tidy Data Principles Followed:
- Each **variable** has its own **column** (e.g., `Event`, `Medalist`).
- Each **observation** (medalist's performance) is in its **own row**.
- Each **type of observational unit** (medalist, event, medal count) forms its **own table**.

## 🚀 How to Run the App
### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Before running the app, install the required Python libraries:
