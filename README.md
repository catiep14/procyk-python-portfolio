# procyk-python-portfolio

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository serves as a showcase for my Python projects, highlighting my skills in data analysis, visualization, machine learning, and software development. It is designed to reflect my growth as a Python programmer and provide a structured, professional portfolio for potential employers or collaborators to explore.

## Repository Organization Plan
I plan to structure my porfolio like this:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Notebooks and scripts focused on exploratory insights.

- **Visualizations:**
  - Projects showcasing data visualization.

- **Project-Specific Folders:**
  - Each major project will have its own folder, including a README file explaining the project‚Äôs purpose, datasets, methods, and results.

### üèÖ [Tidy Data: 2008 Olympics Medalists](https://github.com/yourusername/TidyData-Project)  
**Description:**  
This project applies **tidy data principles** to clean, transform, and visualize data from the **2008 Olympics medalists dataset**. It restructures raw data into a long format using `pandas`, ensuring **each variable has its own column, each observation has its own row, and each observational unit forms its own table**. The **Streamlit** app provides interactive visualizations, helping users explore Olympic medal distributions.  

**How it Fits My Portfolio:**  
- Demonstrates **data wrangling & preprocessing** using `pandas`  
- Showcases **data visualization** skills with `matplotlib` & `seaborn`  
- Implements **interactive web apps** with `Streamlit`  

### üìä [Your First Project Title](https://github.com/yourusername/First-Project)  
**Description:**  
(Provide a brief description of your first project, its goals, technologies used, and key takeaways.)
