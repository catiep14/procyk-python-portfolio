# üèÖ Tidy Data Project ‚Äî 2008 Olympics Medalists  
üîó View Tidy Olympics App Repository

This project is a data cleaning and visualization web app that transforms the 2008 Olympics medalist dataset using tidy data principles. Built with Python and Streamlit, the app makes messy, raw data accessible for meaningful analysis and interactive exploration.

---

### üåü Why This Project Matters

This Tidy Data App demonstrates my ability to:

- Apply **tidy data** principles to restructure real-world datasets
- Build intuitive dashboards using **Streamlit**
- Work with **pandas** to perform advanced data wrangling and reshaping
- Visualize structured data through **bar charts**, **pie charts**, and **filterable tables**
- Present insights in a clean, interactive format for non-technical users

---

### üß∞ How It Fits into My Portfolio

This project highlights my growing proficiency in:

- **Data cleaning and transformation** using Python and pandas
- Building **domain-specific dashboards** to explore structured data
- Applying **best practices in data formatting** (1 variable = 1 column, 1 observation = 1 row)
- Making raw datasets actionable for visual analytics and storytelling

It complements other projects in my portfolio by showing how I can take **messy, untidy data** and turn it into **clean, insightful visualizations** that make complex patterns easy to understand.

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) App ‚Äî Harry Potter Edition

This project is a fun and interactive web app that explores **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using spaCy and Streamlit, themed around the **Harry Potter universe**. Users can enter or upload text, then choose from predefined custom entity types like `CHARACTER`, `SPELL`, `HOUSE`, and more. The app uses spaCy‚Äôs `EntityRuler` to apply these custom patterns and visually highlight detected entities in the text.

### üåü Why This Project Matters

This NER App demonstrates my ability to:
- Work with **natural language processing (NLP)** libraries like **spaCy**
- Build and style interactive **web apps using Streamlit**
- Apply **custom rule-based logic** for domain-specific applications
- Enhance user experience with thoughtful design and UI/UX touches

### üß∞ How It Fits into My Portfolio

This project showcases my growing skills in **data processing**, **app development**, and **creative problem-solving**. It complements other projects in this portfolio by highlighting my ability to work with **unstructured text data**, develop **usable tools for niche audiences**, and incorporate **playful design** into functional applications.

# üì∞ Fake News Classifier App ‚Äî Real vs. Fake News Detection  
üîó View Fake News App Repository

This project is an interactive Streamlit web app that analyzes news articles to determine whether they are **real** or **fake**, using NLP techniques and a logistic regression classifier trained on real-world data. It‚Äôs designed to make fake news detection intuitive and accessible for users, with tools to explore, train, and test fake news models in real time.

---

### üåü Why This Project Matters

This Fake News Analyzer demonstrates my ability to:

- Work with natural language processing (NLP) libraries like **scikit-learn** and **TfidfVectorizer**
- Build interactive web apps using **Streamlit**
- Implement real-world classification models using logistic regression
- Handle data ingestion, cleaning, model training, and prediction in an end-to-end pipeline
- Design informative visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and word clouds to communicate insights

---

### üß∞ How It Fits into My Portfolio

This project highlights my growing proficiency in:

- **Applied machine learning** on real datasets
- Developing **data-centric tools** that are both functional and user-friendly
- **Creating intuitive user experiences** around serious topics like misinformation
- Applying best practices in Python development, from modular code to data validation and user feedback

It complements other projects in my portfolio by showing how I can handle **unstructured text data**, deploy **interactive ML apps**, and communicate results clearly through visual storytelling.
