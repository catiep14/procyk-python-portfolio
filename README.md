# procyk-python-portfolio

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository serves as a showcase for my Python projects, highlighting my skills in data analysis, visualization, machine learning, and software development. It is designed to reflect my growth as a Python programmer and provide a structured, professional portfolio for potential employers or collaborators to explore.

## Repository Organization Plan
I plan to structure my porfolio like this:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Notebooks and scripts focused on exploratory insights.

- **Visualizations:**
  - Projects showcasing data visualization.

- **Project-Specific Folders:**
  - Each major project will have its own folder, including a README file explaining the project‚Äôs purpose, datasets, methods, and results.

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) App ‚Äî Harry Potter Edition

üîó [View NER App Repository](https://github.com/your-username/NERStreamlitApp)

This project is a fun and interactive web app that explores **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using spaCy and Streamlit, themed around the **Harry Potter universe**. Users can enter or upload text, then choose from predefined custom entity types like `CHARACTER`, `SPELL`, `HOUSE`, and more. The app uses spaCy‚Äôs `EntityRuler` to apply these custom patterns and visually highlight detected entities in the text.

### üåü Why This Project Matters

This NER App demonstrates my ability to:
- Work with **natural language processing (NLP)** libraries like **spaCy**
- Build and style interactive **web apps using Streamlit**
- Apply **custom rule-based logic** for domain-specific applications
- Enhance user experience with thoughtful design and UI/UX touches

### üß∞ How It Fits into My Portfolio

This project showcases my growing skills in **data processing**, **app development**, and **creative problem-solving**. It complements other projects in this portfolio by highlighting my ability to work with **unstructured text data**, develop **usable tools for niche audiences**, and incorporate **playful design** into functional applications.
