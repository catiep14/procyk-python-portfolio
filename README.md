# procyk-python-portfolio

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository serves as a showcase for my Python projects, highlighting my skills in data analysis, visualization, machine learning, and software development. It is designed to reflect my growth as a Python programmer and provide a structured, professional portfolio for potential employers or collaborators to explore.

## Repository Organization Plan
I plan to structure my porfolio like this:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Notebooks and scripts focused on exploratory insights.

- **Visualizations:**
  - Projects showcasing data visualization.

- **Project-Specific Folders:**
  - Each major project will have its own folder, including a README file explaining the projectâ€™s purpose, datasets, methods, and results.
